cmdparse allows the creation of "command style" programs, like `git` or `svn`, that perform different
functions depending on which command is invoked. Additionally, nesting of commands, i.e. commands
that take commands themselves, is also possible. For option parsing, the battle-tested Ruby standard
library `optparse` is used.

It was developed out of the need of a command style parsing library for [webgen](webgen.html). Since
back then no useful library was available cmdparse was born.
