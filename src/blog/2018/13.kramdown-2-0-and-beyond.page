The [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org) project has become an umbrella project for many
parsers, converters, math engines, ... It is time to split things apart to make them more manageable
and have faster release cycles.

--- name:content

Once kramdown was really a **pure-Ruby** Markdown-superset conversion library. Nowadays, it includes
many extensions that rely on Ruby gems with C extensions or even on other programming languages like
NodeJS. This makes updating and testing kramdown more time intensive since one has to install and
manage all dependencies -- and as we all know, NodeJS *loves* dependencies...

Therefore starting with release 2.0 the core kramdown gem will be reduced to a meaningful subset of
extensions, and all other extension will get their own gem. This will allow more independent
development and faster releases.

I will still develop the core kramdown gem and I will help out with the extensions if I have time
but as of now I'm looking for developers/maintainers for the following extensions (**[contact
me if you are interested](mailto:t_leitner@gmx.at)**):

* GFM parser
* PDF converter
* mathjaxnode math engine
* sskatex math engine
* katex math engine
* itex2mml math engine
* ritex math engine
* coderay syntax highlighter

The plan is to release the next kramdown version with the current pending changes. Then kramdown 2.0
and all extension gems (in their 1.0 version) will be released, with no code changes. From this
point onwards each gem has its own release cycle.
