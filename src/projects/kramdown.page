kramdown is a fast, pure Ruby Markdown superset converter, using a strict syntax definition and
supporting several common extensions.

It is behind the conversion of the Markdown files for this website and many others. The popular
static website generator [Jekyll] in version 3 also uses it as its default Markdown engine which
incidentally means that [Github Pages] uses it, too.

## History

kramdown was developed because the maintainer of [Maruku], the best Markdown converter for Ruby in
2008, didn't have time for Maruku anymore but there were still bugs in it. After looking at the code
of Maruku it was clear that fixing the problems and adding additional functionality would probably
mean a massive redesign.

Therefore I developed kramdown from scratch, taking the best ideas from Maruku, like the [inline
attribute lists][ial], and other Markdown implementations like [PHP Markdown Extra][phpmd].

After about a year of development and once kramdown was in a usable state I released the first
version 0.1.0 in November 2009. Since then major enhancements have been added and its functionality
greatly extended.

Finally, in March 2013 the first stable version 1.0.0 was released. The biggest change in this
release was actually a change in the license, from GPL to MIT. Although repeatedly asked to do this
I was initially reluctant. However, at that time there was a proliferation of Markdown converters
for Ruby and to further adoption of kramdown the license changed was probably the right thing.
