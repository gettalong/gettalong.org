HexaPDF is a pure Ruby library with an accompanying application for working with PDF files. In
short, it allows

* **creating** new PDF files,
* **manipulating** existing PDF files,
* **merging** multiple PDF files into one,
* **extracting** meta information, text, images and files from PDF files,
* **securing** PDF files by encrypting them and
* **optimizing** PDF files for smaller file size or other criteria.

HexaPDF was designed with ease of use and performance in mind. It uses lazy loading and lazy
computing when possible and tries to produce small PDF files by default.

The initial version provides the basic functionalities for reading and writing PDFs as well as
low-level support for creating PDFs. You can find some code examples on how to use the library on
the [HexaPDF website].

The command line application currently provides commands for

* getting general information about a PDF file,
* extracting files from a PDF file,
* modifying a PDF file (file size optimization, decryption, encryption, page selection and page
  rotation),
* and for inspecting the internal objects and streams of a PDF file.

In the future the application will provide the full range of standard PDF operations. This means,
for example, that commands for merging and splitting will be added.
