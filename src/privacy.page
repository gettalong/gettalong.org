title: Privacy Policy
---
I value the privacy of your data and only process it according to the laws
(GDPR, TKG2003). In this privacy policy I inform you about the most important
aspects of data processing within the <code>*.gettalong.org</code> websites.


### Web Analytics

I use [Matomo] for web analytics. Matomo uses a persistent cookie (a small data
file that gets stored on your computer by a website) to detect recurring
visits. It is self-hosted and therefore no data is given to third-parties. IP
addresses are anonymized and visitors are not tracked across websites.
Individual tracking data is deleted after 180 days.

If you have activated the ["Do Not Track" feature][dnt] of your browser, your
visits are not tracked. Alternatively, you can opt-out of being tracked below:

### Logging

When accessing the websites, some data is logged (truncated IP address, date
and time of access, referrer URL and user agent used by the client) for one
month to help in fixing errors and optimizing the websites.


### Your Rights

You have the right to be informed, of access, to rectification, to erasure, to
restricted processing, to data portability and the right to object. If you
believe that your rights with respect to your privacy have been violated, you
can file a complaint at the [Austrian data protection agency][dpa]
("Datenschutzbeh√∂rde").
