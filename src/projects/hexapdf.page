HexaPDF is a pure Ruby library with an accompanying application for working with PDF files. In
short, it allows

* **creating** new PDF files,
* **manipulating** existing PDF files,
* **merging** multiple PDF files into one,
* **extracting** meta information, text, images and files from PDF files,
* **securing** PDF files by encrypting them and
* **optimizing** PDF files for smaller file size or other criteria.

HexaPDF was designed with ease of use and performance in mind. It uses lazy loading and lazy
computing when possible and tries to produce small PDF files by default.

It uses [cmdparse](cmdparse.html) for its command line application.
