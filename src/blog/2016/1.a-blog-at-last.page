I never really started blogging all these years although I developed a [static website
generator][wg] and a [Markdown converter][kd] ages ago. Don't know why really... probably thought
that I wouldn't find the time to actually post something.

But now is always a better time to start than never, isn't it? :-)

**What will I blog about?** Since I'm programming in my spare time I will write about programming
and software engineering, especially in the context of the programming language Ruby. And probably
about problem solving in general.

**Why about Ruby?** It is the language I use nearly on a daily basis and therefore know most
intimately. My open source projects use Ruby and can provide examples of real world code for
discussion.

I already have some ideas for posts about HexaPDF, my newest Ruby project, a full-featured PDF
reader and writer.
