ruby-amt is a Ruby library for controlling Intel AMT (Active Management Technology) 5.0 devices
(part of Intel vPro). It does this by implementing the client side of the SOAP protocol defined by
Intel for Intel AMT devices.

It works really well for AMT 5.0 devices. However, later version started to drop support for the
SOAP protocol and rely on the WSMAN specification for API interaction, so ruby-amt cannot be used
for those.
