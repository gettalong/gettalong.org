webgen is a static website generator written in Ruby. Since its inception in 2003 it was constantly
developed and enhanced and it powers this website.

It is very flexible and customizable:

* There is no need for a fixed directory structure and therefore one can easily embed the source of
  a webgen website in a project repository (see [cmdparse's website source][cmdparse] for an
  example).

* Partial generation saves time by only regenerating the needed files.

* No need to know Ruby to use nearly all of its functionality. YAML files are used for configuration
  and to specify meta information, so non-programmers can easily learn to use it.

It uses [cmdparse](cmdparse.html) for its command line client and [kramdown](kramdown.html) as the
main markup language engine.

## History

I developed webgen out of the need of such a tool since back in 2003 my webspace only supported
static files, not PHP or anything else. Initially I searched for such a tool but found nothing
satisfying.

As I have been using Ruby for some years I decided to write it myself in Ruby. After a short design
phase I implemented the first version and it worked like charm.

One can say that I became proficient in writing Ruby while developing webgen. Each major release,
i.e. 0.1.0, 0.4.0, 0.5.0 and finally 1.0.0 had many breaking changes since the complete core was
redesigned each time. Yes, one shouldn't do this and this probably also led to many people
abandoning webgen. However, 0.x versions meant for me that I can do this and each iteration made the
code better, clearer and easier to read and work with (Would *you* want to work with a plugin system
based on `callcc`? Version 0.4.0 had one...).
